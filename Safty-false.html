    <h1>Safety: Your Fortress of the Future</h1>
        <p>
            When it comes to keeping you safe, this smart home takes things seriously. It‚Äôs got everything from high-tech fire alarms to a squad of venomous snakes (yup, you heard that right). Safety isn‚Äôt just a feature here‚Äîit‚Äôs an art form. Let‚Äôs break down how this house has you covered, 24/7.

                    <li> Fire Alarm: Warning Lights & Voice Alerts
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                                We‚Äôve all heard fire alarms, but this one doesn‚Äôt just beep at you‚Äîit talks to you. When things heat up, the house alerts you with a booming voice and flashing lights that make sure you know exactly what's going down. No more wondering if that beeping is just your toast burning or something more serious.

                        Water Walls: Ceiling Protection
                    </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                                Forget fire extinguishers‚Äîthis house fights flames with an automatic water system that sprays from the ceiling and walls. It‚Äôs like having an indoor sprinkler system that kicks in before you even think to call 911. The moment the fire alarm senses danger, the water system jumps into action, keeping your home safe from top to bottom.

                                <li> 
                                    When the water comes down, the water rats come out. These little firefighting bots scurry around like pros, making sure the flames don‚Äôt stand a chance. They‚Äôre like your own personal fire brigade, ready to extinguish any leftover sparks with precision.
                                </li>

    <li> 20 Snakes: Venomous Security
        <ul>
            <li> This might sound wild, but hear us out. Your home‚Äôs ultimate defense? Twenty venomous snakes. Yeah, that‚Äôs right. When danger strikes, these mechanical serpents release a green froth (yup, venom!) to protect your home from intruders or threats. It‚Äôs like having a full-on snake squad keeping everything in check. Who‚Äôs gonna mess with you when you‚Äôve got that kind of backup?

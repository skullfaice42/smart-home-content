                Fire Alarm: Warning Lights & Voice Alerts

            <p>
                We’ve all heard fire alarms, but this one doesn’t just beep at you—it talks to you. When things heat up, the house alerts you with a booming voice and flashing lights that make sure you know exactly what's going down. No more wondering if that beeping is just your toast burning or something more serious.

                    Forget fire extinguishers—this house fights flames with an automatic water system that sprays from the ceiling and walls. It’s like having an indoor sprinkler system that kicks in before you even think to call 911. The moment the fire alarm senses danger, the water system jumps into action, keeping your home safe from top to bottom.

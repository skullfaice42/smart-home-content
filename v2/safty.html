                <h3>Fire Alarm: Warning Lights & Voice Alerts</h3>
                <p>
                    We‚Äôve all heard fire alarms, but this one doesn‚Äôt just beep at you‚Äîit talks to you. When things heat up, the house alerts you with a booming voice and flashing lights that make sure you know exactly what's going down. No more wondering if that beeping is just your toast burning or something more serious.

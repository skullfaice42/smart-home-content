    <h1>
        THE Smart Home
    </h1>

    <h2>
        A Home That Thinks for You
    </h2>
    <!-- here all you want to do is make sure you can group this one and the rest... that way you can save lots of time :) -->
    <img src="images/brain house.jpg" height="200" alt="Home with Brain">
        <p>
            This ain't just some basic smart home‚Äîit‚Äôs 
            got a brain. Yup, a memory system that works 
            like cloud storage but, you know, cooler. It tracks
             your routines, stores your preferences, and handles 
             everything from schedules to security. Need to lock
              down the house? Password protected. Got a pet? No
               worries, the sound recognition system‚Äôs got you
                covered. It even gives unwanted critters the
                 boot with automatic shutters and shade controls.
                  Talk about savage!
        </p>

    <h2>
            Automated Convenience? You Bet!
    </h2>
    <img src="images/automation.webp" height="200" alt="Automation House">
        <p>Mornings here start smooth. A voice-activated
                 clock wakes you up like a personal assistant‚Äîwithout 
                 the attitude. Forget breakfast hassles, the stove‚Äôs 
                 got it handled. Weather forecast? Check. 
                 Garage doors? Done. You can even chill on the
                  patio with card games, cold drinks, and some tunes, 
                  all with a single command. Oh, and don‚Äôt forget 
                  the bed warmers for that extra cozy vibe after a 
                  long day. This house is basically your best friend
                   that never forgets anything.
        </p>

    <h2>
        Cleaning? What Cleaning?
    </h2>
    <img src="images/cleaning what cleaning.jpg" height="200" alt="Cleaning Rats">
        <p>Who needs to scrub and dust when you‚Äôve got 
                a crew of robot mice? These little guys handle 
                dirt like it‚Äôs their only job. Bigger trash? 
                Copper rats take care of that, dragging it to
                 the incinerator like it‚Äôs nothing. And an 
                 aluminum wedge dishwasher? Yeah, dishes practically 
                 clean themselves. So go ahead, relax‚Äîthe house
                  has your back.
        </p>

    <h2>
        Safety First (And Second, And Third)
    </h2>
    <img src="images/safty.jpeg" height="200" alt="Fire dector">
        <p>When it comes to security, this home doesn‚Äôt play.
                     Fire alarms come with loud warnings and flashing 
                     lights. But wait, there‚Äôs more‚Äîif fire breaks out,
                      the house deploys water from the ceiling and walls
                       like it‚Äôs no big deal. And just in case, there‚Äôs 
                       a squad of water rats ready to take out any 
                       remaining flames. Oh, and did we mention the
                        venomous snakes and robots with green chemical 
                        froth? Yeah, safety game‚Äôs on lock.
        </p>

    <h2>
        Entertainment Central
    </h2>
    <img src="images/entertanment.jpg" height="200" alt="Entertainment Central">
        <p>Need some chill time? Head over to the study, 
                    where a fireplace sets the mood, and a poetry reader 
                    gives you that cultured vibe. You‚Äôve got music, comfy
                     chairs, and all the ambiance you need to unwind or
                      impress your friends. And for the little ones 
                      (or your inner kid), the nursery‚Äôs got glass walls
                       with interactive media, smells, and sounds that‚Äôll 
                       make it feel like you‚Äôre stepping into another world.
        </p>

    <h2>
        Welcome to the Future
    </h2>
        <p>So, there it is. The Soft Rains house is more than
                         just a place to crash‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle upgrade.
                          You bring the 90‚Äôs nostalgia, and this house will
                           handle the rest. What‚Äôs not to love?
        </p>

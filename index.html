            Hey, check out this rad house straight outta the future—it's like having your very own RoboCop! You’ll get a voice-activated breakfast stove, automated cleaning critters, and shudders that freak out pesky raccoons. Plus, it’s got everything from a poetry-reading fireplace to a bed warmer that'll make you feel like you’re sleeping on a cloud!

        <p class="card1">
            This ain't just some basic smart home—it’s 
            got a brain. Yup, a memory system that works 
            like cloud storage but, you know, cooler. It tracks
             your routines, stores your preferences, and handles 
             everything from schedules to security. Need to lock
              down the house? Password protected. Got a pet? No
               worries, the sound recognition system’s got you
                covered. It even gives unwanted critters the
                 boot with automatic shutters and shade controls.
                  Talk about savage!

    <h2>
            Automated Convenience? You Bet!
    </h2>
    <section class="flex-daddy">
    <img class="images1" src="images/automation.webp"  alt="Automation House">
        <p class="card1">Mornings here start smooth. A voice-activated
                 clock wakes you up like a personal assistant—without 
                 the attitude. Forget breakfast hassles, the stove’s 
                 got it handled. Weather forecast? Check. 
                 Garage doors? Done. You can even chill on the
                  patio with card games, cold drinks, and some tunes, 
                  all with a single command. Oh, and don’t forget 
                  the bed warmers for that extra cozy vibe after a 
                  long day. This house is basically your best friend
                   that never forgets anything.

        Cleaning? What Cleaning?

        <p class="card1">Who needs to scrub and dust when you’ve got 
                a crew of robot mice? These little guys handle 
                dirt like it’s their only job. Bigger trash? 
                Copper rats take care of that, dragging it to
                 the incinerator like it’s nothing. And an 
                 aluminum wedge dishwasher? Yeah, dishes practically 
                 clean themselves. So go ahead, relax—the house
                  has your back.

        <p class="card1">When it comes to security, this home doesn’t play.
                     Fire alarms come with loud warnings and flashing 
                     lights. But wait, there’s more—if fire breaks out,
                      the house deploys water from the ceiling and walls
                       like it’s no big deal. And just in case, there’s 
                       a squad of water rats ready to take out any 
                       remaining flames. Oh, and did we mention the
                        venomous snakes and robots with green chemical 
                        froth? Yeah, safety game’s on lock.

        <p class="card1">Need some chill time? Head over to the study, 
                    where a fireplace sets the mood, and a poetry reader 
                    gives you that cultured vibe. You’ve got music, comfy
                     chairs, and all the ambiance you need to unwind or
                      impress your friends. And for the little ones 
                      (or your inner kid), the nursery’s got glass walls
                       with interactive media, smells, and sounds that’ll 
                       make it feel like you’re stepping into another world.

        <p class="bott">So, there it is. The Soft Rains house is more than
                         just a place to crash—it’s a lifestyle upgrade.
                          You bring the 90’s nostalgia, and this house will
                           handle the rest. What’s not to love?
